Create an API that functions as a TODO list.
I am doing this mostly from just the Fastapi documentation and what I can google around.
This is not based off of a specific tutorial.
I want to be able perform all CRUD functions with the API.

TODO list for this app.
1. Add items to the TODO list.                          => DONE
2. Query a list of active items in the TODO list.       => IN PROGRESS
    A. Currently able to query all TODO items.          => DONE
    B. Able to query by TODO items of a specific status => DONE
3. Update items in the TODO list.
    A. add detail to the item
    B. mark an item complete
4. Create a list of recently completed items.
5. Generate a productivity report.
6. Send a reminder of items to add to report.
7. Need to take an attempt at security.
    A. Do this last.
