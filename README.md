Create an API that functions as a TODO list.
I am doing this mostly from just the Fastapi documentation and what I can google around.
This is not based off of a specific tutorial.
I want to be able perform all CRUD functions with the API.

TODO list for this api:
- Add items to the TODO list.                             => DONE
- Query a list of  items in the TODO list.                => DONE
    - Currently able to query all TODO items for a user.  => DONE
    - Able to query by TODO items of a specific status    => DONE
- Update items in the TODO list.                          => HOLD
    - add detail to the item.                             => HOLD
    - change the status of an item.                       => DONE
- Set due dates                                           
    - Create reminders.                                   
    - Find ways to remind.                                
- Need to take an attempt at security.                    
    - Do this last.                                       


TODO list for a front end:
- Create a rough front end for testing                    => DONE (FOR NOW)
    - class that can make API calls current functions.    => DONE
    - segmenting classes by call type.                    => DONE 
    - Create an interface to be able to run easily.       


Clean up items:
- Clean up the SQL queries that have * in them to be more specific.
- Need to be better about what we return in calls. 

2022/12/13 => High Priority
Need to make some sort of a rough interface for making API calls and better testing. Currently using the interactive docs that come with the application is great but I'd like to get an idea about how I would use them in a more practical sense.

2022/12/17 => Notes
I've mostly addressed my note from 12/13 I have a rough, way to make API calls so I can see what i need to put into data. I don't have a proper front end (website or something). Will need to spend some time on that at some point.
