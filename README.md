Create an API that functions as a TODO list.
I am doing this mostly from just the Fastapi documentation and what I can google around.
This is not based off of a specific tutorial.
I want to be able perform all CRUD functions with the API.

TODO list for this api:
- Add items to the TODO list.                             => DONE
- Query a list of  items in the TODO list.                => DONE
    - Currently able to query all TODO items for a user.  => DONE
    - Able to query by TODO items of a specific status    => DONE
- Update items in the TODO list.                          => IN PROGRESS
    - add detail to the item.                             => IN PROGRESS
    - change the status of an item.                       => DONE
- Set due dates
    - Create reminders.
    - Find ways to remind.
- Need to take an attempt at security.
    - Do this last.

TODO list for a front end:
- Create a front end for the app. 

Clean up items:
- Clean up the SQL queries that have * in them to be more specific.
