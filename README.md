Create an API that functions as a TODO list.
I am doing this mostly from just the Fastapi documentation and what I can google around.
This is not based off of a specific tutorial.
I want to be able perform all CRUD functions with the API.

TODO list for this app.
- Add items to the TODO list.                             => DONE
- Query a list of active items in the TODO list.          => IN PROGRESS 
    - Currently able to query all TODO items for a user.  => DONE
    - Able to query by TODO items of a specific status    => DONE
- Update items in the TODO list.
    - add detail to the item
    - mark an item complete
- Create a list of recently completed items.
- Generate a productivity report.
- Send a reminder of items to add to report.
- Need to take an attempt at security.
    - Do this last.
